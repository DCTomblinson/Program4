# Program4
 Program #4 README Devon Tomblinson, April 20, 2020  1. Program status (what works, what doesn't) Everything works perfectly. MyEdge and MyGraph implement Edge210 and Graph210 respectively.   2. Do you have quality code?  /* See our coding guidelines, Javadoc, chunks, etc */ My code is quality. Javadoc, lowercase variable, capital classes, all upercase constants with underscores between words, and commented chunks of code.    3. How to run your program just run the main in the Program4.java, the terminal prompts will explain the user input required. Runs in a loop until key word Exit is entered. The results are written to a results.txt file created locally.  4. Creative element My creative element is that I have a unique user prompt and messages for the choices that the user makes. It has the 4 files lines up neatly to choose from and continues to allow the user to choose another file to replace the old one.   5. Results All the results are in a results folder for tinyEWG.txt, mediumEWG.txt, 1000EWG.txt, 10000EWG.txt in the forms of tiny_results.txt, medium_results.txt,  1000_results.txt, and 10000_results.txt respectively.
